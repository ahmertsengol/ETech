## 🚀 Getting Started

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/your-username/ai-learning-psychology.git
cd ai-learning-psychology

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Run the demo
python demo.py
```

### Quick Demo

```python
from src.ai.core.psychology_analyzer import LearningPsychologyAnalyzer

# Initialize the analyzer
analyzer = LearningPsychologyAnalyzer()

# Analyze a learning session
analysis = analyzer.analyze_learning_session(
    behavioral_data=your_data,
    user_id="student_123",
    session_id="session_456",
    content_id="module_789"
)

# Get real-time adaptations
adaptations = analysis['adaptations']
for adaptation in adaptations:
    print(f"Recommendation: {adaptation.decision_type}")
    print(f"Reason: {adaptation.reason}")
    print(f"Priority: {adaptation.priority}/5")
```

## 📈 Demo Scenarios

Run `python demo.py` to see three different learner scenarios:

1. **Normal Learner**: Balanced attention and cognitive load
2. **Distracted Learner**: Low attention, needs intervention
3. **Engaged Learner**: High performance, ready for challenges

Each scenario demonstrates different AI model responses and adaptation strategies.
